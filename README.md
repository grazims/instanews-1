Proyect summary



The goal of this project was to build a responsive website that would access the NY Times API, retrieve its JSON data, and use this data to populate our website. The way our project was built was using a mobile first approach and the changing things accordingly to the different breakpoints. We then appended the necessary data to our html using javascript, and finally styling everything according to what it needed.
